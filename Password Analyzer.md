Conquered Password Security: Password Analyzer Tool.

A Password Strength Checker! This tool helps users evaluate password strength and receive recommendations for creating secure passwords.

Excited to share my accomplishment - I've built two versions of a Password Analyzer! üõ°Ô∏è

User-Friendly GUI: This desktop application offers a visually intuitive interface for analyzing password strength. Users can easily input passwords and receive clear feedback on various aspects like length, character types, and potential weaknesses.

Web-Based Powerhouse: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this version allows users to analyze passwords directly in a web browser. It's lightweight, accessible, and perfect for on-the-go security checks. üåê
